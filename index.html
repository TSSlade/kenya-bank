              <p>Poverty rates are highest in the north and southeast, where there are also less schools available.

              <p>Literacy is one measurement of the performance of an education system. High literacy rates throughout many districts are the result of a strong primary education system. However, many gaps can be seen, with some literacy rates falling below 20 percent in arid areas with lower populations.</p>

              <p>Exam results from 2010 show a range of positive performance. Districts in the north west performed considerably well on primary exams.</p>
              <p>When looking at <a href='#' class='narrative' data-which-narrative='6'>performance over the last four years</a>, many counties have increased the number of passing students while others have declined.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>Net enrollment rate is the percentage of eligible school-age children who are enrolled in a school. It is a measure of overall access, but also of gender equity. In Kenya, enrollment is fairly uniform in the most populated areas.</p>
            <p>Still ensuring students are learning, once they are in class, remains a challenge. Factors such as <a href='#' class='narrative' data-which-narrative='9'>pupil-teacher ratios</a> can determine the effectiveness of their education.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>The quality of education differs dramatically between public and private schools, with the average pupil-teacher ratio in public primary schools almost 3 times higher than private. High student to pupil ratios are seen where there are poor exam results.</p>
			  <p>See Bungoma county where the average ratio is 65 pupils per teacher.</p>

    <h3>About the site</h3>      
	<p>The Exploring Kenyan Education site investigates the education sector in Kenya and visualizes location data for all primary and secondary schools across the country. By mapping school locations with education outcomes and investment data, the site provides insight into the state of education within Kenya.</p>
	<h3>Methodology</h3>
	<p>Data work was carried out using OpenOffice and SQLite to join attribute data with spatial data for the purpose of visualization. Data was obtained and collected from the <a href="https://opendata.go.ke/">Kenya OpenData portal</a> and official Government of Kenya data. In cases of pre-2010 data, district names were updated to the 47 2010-designated counties. Data was aggregated and formatted into county-level tables and joined to county-level geographic data. Averages, minimums, and maximums were calculated to be included in the visualization.</p> 
	<p>School location data was downloaded from the Kenya OpenData portal. Latitude and longitude data for 37,725 primary and secondary schools were reformatted for proper use in mapping applications. All points were plotted on the map, including schools that are listed with zero enrollment. It is unknown to whether these locations have invalid data, missing data, or are closed.</p> 
	<p>Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam results were obtained from the Kenyan National Examination Council. Exam results were listed by school with gender and score categorizations. Percentages of students passing (C+ or higher for secondary, or a score higher than 250 for primary) were calculated for both the KCPE and the KCSE exam results. Results were aggregated to county-level averages. The exam results only contained county location identifiers and did not include a national school identifier code so only county-level aggregations were able to be visualized.</p>
	<p>Other contextual data was obtained from the Kenya OpenData portal. Data was matched to county administrative geographic data by county name. There is no official source of county administrative boundary geographic data. This site used county geographic data made <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5f83ca29e5b849b8b05bc0b281ae27bc">publicly available online</a>.</p>
	<p>All maps were created with <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill">TileMill</a> and hosted with <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a>. Color scales were determined based on natural breaks within each of the visualized indicators.</p>
